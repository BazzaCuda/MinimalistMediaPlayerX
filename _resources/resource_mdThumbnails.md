<br />

When viewing an image in the **Image & Thumbnail Browser**, you can switch to [**T**]humbnail mode
- a page of thumbnails will be displayed starting with the image you were viewing*<br />_(* assuming there are enough thumbnails to fill more than one page, otherwise the one page of thumbnails will contain all the images in the current folder)_
- left-click on any thumbnail to view the full size image
- you can browse through pages of thumbnails the same way you browse through individual images
- you can navigate up and down to other folders on the same drive
- in the Image & Thumbnail Browser, the four arrow keys are very powerful, whether in Image Mode or Thumbnail Mode
- you can browse through an entire drive with just the arrow keys, automatically skipping folders which don't contain images

**Resizing the Thumbnails Page**

When showing a page of thumbnails, you can resize the window to show more thumbnails per row<br />
- you can resize either by grabbing the window border and dragging or by using **[G]** and Ctrl-**[G]**
- this will cause **MMP** to immediately refresh the thumbnails to draw as many per row as possible, and as many columns as possible
- because of this redrawing, it is preferable to not resize by dragging the window border
- **[G]** will recalculate the window size required to accommodate another column and another row of thumbnails
- Ctrl-**[G]** will recalculate the window size required to reduce the display by one column and one row of thumbnails
- resizing the window and redrawing the thumbnails is quicker using **[G]** and Ctrl-**[G]**
- once you have reached the maximum number of rows (with **[M]** or **[G]**), subsequently pressing **[G]** will expand the number of columns width-ways until the maximum window size is reached
