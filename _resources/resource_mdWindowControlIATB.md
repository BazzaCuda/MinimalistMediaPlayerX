You can resize the window so that the image is displayed at the exact dimensions you require

- as you resize the window, the new dimensions will be displayed in the status bar
- the status bar displays the dimensions of the image file itself, e.g. **800 x 600**
- the status bar _also_ shows the dimensions that the image is currently being displayed at, e.g. **D: 1880 x 1200**
- as you resize the window, the **D: ??? x ???** dimensions will change
- if you take an **MMP** screenshot (Ctrl-**[S]**), the High Definition .png file will have the _exact_ same dimensions as shown in the **D: ???** status bar panel
<br />
<br />

- as you resize the window, you will find that the image display will compensate by adding black borders around the image
- you can remove these by hitting **[J]** to ad[J]ust the window to match the aspect ratio of the image
- this takes your resized _height_ of the window and ad[J]usts the _width_ so that together they now match the image's aspect ratio
