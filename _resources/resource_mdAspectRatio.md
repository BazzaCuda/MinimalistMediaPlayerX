Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of a video, an image, or a window<br />

- it determines whether the video/image will fit the window properly or whether it might be displayed stretched or letterboxed
- if there is a discrepancy between the size and shape of the image/video and the window in which it's being displayed, black borders might be added to fill the gaps between the edges of the image or video and the edges of the window
- these borders might be added above and below, or on the sides, or both

**MMP** always maintains the correct aspect ratio, both for videos and images, even when you resize the window
- videos and images will never appear stretched

The **Main Media Window** automatically resizes so that you never get borders added around a video
- it resizes to exactly match the Aspect Ratio of the video
- in other words, the Aspect Ratio of the window is controlled by the Aspect Ratio of the video
- when you manually adjust the size of the window using the mouse you can only adjust the _**height**_ of the window
- you do so by grabbing the bottom edge or a bottom corner with the mouse
- as you drag the mouse to resize the height, **MMP** will automatically adjust the **width** to maintain the correct Aspect Ratio
- resizing can be done much quicker using **[G]** and Ctrl-**[G]** (_see the table below_)
- as you resize, the new display dimensions of the video will be displayed in the [Notification Area](Notification_Area)
- this information is important when taking [Screenshots](Screenshots)

Viewing images in the **Main Media Window** and in the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** works slightly differently
- as with videos, images will never appear stretched; their correct Aspect Ratio will always be maintained
- the window doesn't resize to match every image
- doing so would actually be quite annoying when browsing through images
- the window maintains a constant size
- borders are added, when necessary, to fill the gaps between the edges of the image and the edges of the window
- _**however**_, you can automatically **ad[J]ust** the window so that its Aspect Ratio matches the image's Aspect Ratio
- as with videos, this is important when taking [Screenshots](Screenshots)

**Image & Thumbnail Browser**
- using the mouse, you can resize both the width and height of the window
- resizing can be done much quicker using **[G]** and Ctrl-**[G]** (_see the table below_)
- using **G** / Ctrl-**[G]** is recommended when resizing Thumbnail pages



| Control | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| **[G]**               | [G]reater window size. Can be held down for rapid increase. Auto-Center stays ON |
| Ctrl-**[G]**          | reduce, i.e. un[G]reater, the window size. Can be held down for rapid decrease. Auto-Center stays ON |

| **[J]**               | ad[J]ust the window's Aspect Ratio to match the image's Aspect Ratio |
| **[M]**               | [M]aximize the window to the screen's height while maintaining the correct Aspect Ratio for width. Auto-Center is turned ON |
| **Left click** the window and hold | the window can be dragged/repositioned. Auto-Center is turned OFF |
| **Left double-click** the window   | toggle fullscreen mode |
| grab bottom edge and drag          | resize the window. Auto-Center is turned OFF |
