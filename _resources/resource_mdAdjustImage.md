You can make adjustments to the displayed image or video picture/frame to alter<br />
**brightness**, **contrast**, **gamma**, **rotation** and **saturation**,  and to **zoom** in or out

- an HD screenshot of the image/frame will include your adjustments<br />
<br />
- if you navigate to a different media file, your current adjustments will remain in effect and will be applied to the next media file as well, until you cancel any or all of the adjustments
- increasing the Gamma can often give better results than increasing the Brightness
- all of the increase/decrease, in/out keys can be held down for rapid change
