In **MMP**, a "screenshot" is **_direct-from-memory_** High Definition .png capture of the image or video frame being redendered to your **MMP** window<br />
Consequently, it is of a far higher resolution and quality than a standard Windows desktop screenshot

Any adjustments you make will be included in the screenshot file (see **Adjust Image**)<br />
These include **brightness**, **contrast**, **gamma**, **rotation**, **saturation**, **zoom** in/out, **pan** up/down/left/right, and **rotate**

The dimensions of the .png image file will match the size of the image/frame in the **MMP** window<br />
You can therefore resize the **MMP** window to match the .png file dimensions you desire<br />
There is a direct relationship between the dimensions of your **MMP** window and the size [on disk] of the .png screenshot file

The .png file will be saved to the same folder as the original video or image file

Any on-screen subtitle will be captured in the screenshot

The screenshot will never include the video progress bar or the video timestamp<br />
To include those you will need to take a standard desktop screenshot
