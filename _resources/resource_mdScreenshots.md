In **MMP**, a "screenshot" is a **_direct-from-memory_** High Definition .png capture of the image or video frame being rendered to your **MMP** window

Consequently, a so-called **MMP**  "screenshot" is at a far higher resolution and quality than a standard Windows desktop screenshot

- any adjustments you make will be included in the screenshot file (see [Adjust Image](Adjust_Image))<br />
- these include **brightness**, **contrast**, **gamma**, **rotation**, **saturation**, **zoom** in/out, **pan** up/down/left/right, and **rotate**

- the dimensions of the .png image file will match the size of the image/frame in the **MMP** window<br />
- in the **Main Media Window** these dimensions are displayed in the [Notification Area](Notification_Area) as you resize the window
- in the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** these dimensions are displayed in the **"D: X:Y"** panel of the status bar
- you can therefore resize the **MMP** window to match the .png file dimensions you desire<br />
- there is a direct relationship between the dimensions of your **MMP** window and the size [on disk] of the .png screenshot file

- the .png file will be saved to the same folder as the original video or image file

- any on-screen subtitle will be captured in the screenshot

- the screenshot will never include the video progress bar or the video timestamp<br />
- to include those you will need to take a standard desktop screenshot
