[Config Dialog: Playlist Filter](ConfigDialog:Playlist_Filter)<br />

When you launch MMP by opening a media file from your File Explorer
a playlist will be created containing that file and all the media files in the
same folder that match your Playlist Filter Format

- MMP will always play the media file you used to launch MMP
regardless of your playlist filter*
- if you [or MMP] move to another folder
the new playlist will only contain files that match your filter
- your selected playlist filter only applies to the Main Media Window
- the Image & Thumbnail Browser operates its own playlist of image files only

\* **Best practice is to set the filter to Audio, Video or Audio & Video
and to also set "Open Image in Browser" and "Exit Browser = Exit MMP"**

NB: _With the filter format set to Image, Ctrl-[P]laylist Filter on/off is now the same as [Spacebar] slideshow on/off_<br />
_For audio and video formats, Ctrl-[P] is now redundant because the Main Media Window playlist will always match your filter_
