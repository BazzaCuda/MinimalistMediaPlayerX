**MMP** provides both Frame Forwards and Frame Backwards!

- tapping the arrow keys once will pause the video (if it isn't already paused) and step forwards or backwards one frame
- with the video already paused, each arrow key will move the video by one frame at a time
- with many videos, you can hold down the right and left arrow keys to play the video at normal speed
- with Frame Forwards, this will include audio
- with Frame Backwards, there will be no audio and playback is likely to be just slightly under normal speed
- when you then release the arrow key, the video will pause
- there will likely be a very short delay while the remaining repeat-key messages are processed
