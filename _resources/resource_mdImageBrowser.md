**Best/Recommended Practice for operating MMP**

- best practice is to set [_Open Image in Browser_ and _Exit Browser = Exit MMP_](ConfigDialog:General)
- also set your [Playlist Filter](ConfigDialog:Playlist_Filter) to **_Audio & Video_**
- this will operate **MMP** as, in effect, two applications in one:
    - the **Main Media Window** will handle audio and video files
    - the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** will handle images
<br />
<br />

- after running the _mmp-install.bat_ file that ships with **MMP**, opening an _audio_ or _video_ file from your File Explorer software will launch **MMP** into the **Main Media Window**
- conversely, opening an _image_ file from your File Explorer software will launch **MMP** directly into the **Image & Thumbnail Browser**
- hitting **[Escape]** to exit either of the windows will close **MMP**

With the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** you can browse through your entire image library as thumbnails and/or full size
- the four arrow keys are very powerful, whether in Image Mode or Thumbnail Mode
- you can browse through an entire drive with just the arrow keys, automatically skipping folders which don't contain images
- the status bar at the bottom of the window will display the **X:Y** dimensions of the image file
- it will also display the **"D: X:Y"** dimensions that it's currently being **D**isplayed at
- this information is important when saving [Screenshots](Screenshots)

**Resizing the Thumbnails Page**

When showing a page of thumbnails, you can resize the window to show more thumbnails per row<br />
- you can resize either by grabbing the window border and dragging or by using **[G]** and Ctrl-**[G]**
- this will cause **MMP** to immediately refresh the thumbnails to draw as many per row as possible, and as many columns as possible
- because of this redrawing, it is preferable to not resize by dragging the window border
- **[G]** will recalculate the window size required to accommodate another column and another row of thumbnails
- Ctrl-**[G]** will recalculate the window size required to reduce the display by one column and one row of thumbnails
- resizing the window and redrawing the thumbnails is quicker this way
- once you have reached the maximum number of rows (with **[M]** or **[G]**), subsequently pressing **[G]** will expand the number of columns width-ways until the maximum window size is reached
