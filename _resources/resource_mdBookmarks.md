You can bookmark the current position/timestamp of an audio or video file and restart playback from that point at any time in the future

- the timestamp is saved in the _MinimalistMediaPlayer.conf_ file until such time as you delete it
- you can of course manually edit the _MinimalistMediaPlayer.conf_ file and delete all your bookmarks in one go
- manually editing the .conf file will not disrupt any currently-running copies of **MMP**

**[7]**                     | delete any previously bookmarked timestamp for the current audio or video file
