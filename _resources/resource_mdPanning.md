**Panning** moves the image or video frame up/down/left/right _within_ the **MMP** window

- the arrow keys can be held down for continuous panning

Ctrl **[&uarr;]** up arrow         | pan up - add [Shift] for double speed
Ctrl **[&darr;]** down arrow       | pan down - add [Shift] for double speed
Ctrl **[&larr;]** left arrow       | pan left - add [Shift] for double speed
Ctrl **[&rarr;]** right arrow      | pan right - add [Shift] for double speed

**Mouse Wheel** up/down                  | pan/scroll image up/down - add **[Shift]** to increase scroll amount
Alt and **Mouse Wheel** up/down          | pan/scroll image left/right - add **[Shift]** to increase scroll amount

N.B. Strictly speaking, according to proper video camera work, panning _up_ and _down_ are the wrong way around in **MMP**, as are panning _left_ and _right_. However, as computer users, when we tell software to "pan left" we expect the image to move left. Moving the image left is actually "panning the camera right", but during development being correct was clearly not intuitive, so **MMP** reverses the terms
