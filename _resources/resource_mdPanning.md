**Panning**/**Scrolling** moves the image or video frame up/down/left/right _within_ the **MMP** window

- the **MMP** window stays where it is - only the image moves
- the arrow keys can be held down for continuous panning/scrolling
- video images can be panned/scrolled during playback

| Image & Thumbnail Browser         | all of the above, plus... |
| **Mouse Wheel** up/down           | pan/scroll image up/down |
| Alt and **Mouse Wheel** up/down   | pan/scroll image left/right |
| add **[Shift]**                   | increase pan/scroll amount

N.B. Strictly speaking, according to real video camera work, panning _up_ and _down_ are the wrong way around in **MMP**, as are panning _left_ and _right_. However, as computer users, when we tell software to "pan left" we expect the image to move left. Moving the image left is actually "panning the camera right"; however, during development being correct was clearly not intuitive, so **MMP** reverses the terms
