From the _External Apps_  tab of the Ctrl-**[\\]**  Config Dialog you can define up to three external applications

- the current media file, whether it's an audio file, a video file, or an image file, can be "sent" to any of your defined applications
- the application will launch and try to open the media file
- this is equivalent to you issuing a standard "Open with..." on that file
- for example, one of the applications might be the "Classic" version of MS Paint, which is still popular
- or you might prefer, and be adept with, GIMP or Photoshop, etc
- **MMP** has no inherent knowledge of any of the apps or their purpose or suitability to the current media file
- consequently, as far as **MMP** is concerned, you can quite legitimately send a video to Photoshop. Photoshop will complain; **MMP** won't
