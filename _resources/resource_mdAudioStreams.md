If a media file contains multiple audio streams, you can cycle through them all and select each one in turn<br />

- **[F6]** will cycle to and select the next available audio stream
- the end of the cycle includes "Audio: no" which will mute the audio
- pressing **[F6]** again will cycle to and select the first audio stream
- meta-data details of each track will be shown in the [Notification Area](Notification_Area)<br />
e.g. **Audio: (1) (eng Vorbis 6ch 48000 Hz) [default]**
<br />
If you are listening through an external device (e.g. via a Bluetooth transmitter to your earphones) the audio can lag behind the video images<br />

- you can bring the audio forward in steps of 0.01 using Ctrl-**[\\]**
- repeat this until the audio is in sync with the video
- if you bring the audio forward too much so that it is now ahead of the video you can delay it using Ctrl-**[/]**, again in steps of 0.01
