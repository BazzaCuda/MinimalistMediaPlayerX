If a media file contains multiple audio streams, you can cycle through them all and select each one in turn

- the end of the cycle includes "Audio: no" which will mute the audio
- meta-data details of each track will be shown in the Notification Area (bottom right corner)<br />
e.g. **Audio: (1) (eng Vorbis 6ch 48000 Hz) [default]**


| Control | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| **[F6]** | cycle through all audio tracks in the media file, one at a time |
