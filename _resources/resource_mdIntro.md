<br />
<br />
The Ctrl-**[H]** Quick Help panels (available from the **Main Media Window** and the **Image & Thumbnail Browser**) give a compact summary of all the user-controls available in those windows

**_This_** Ctrl-_Shift_-**[H]** Full Help panel, on the other hand, gives a concise but much more detailed explanation for each topic. It is therefore more suitable for quickly understanding a particular aspect of **MMP**
- it will adjust its contents depending on whether you invoke it<br />from the **Main Media Window** or the **Image & Thumbnail Browser**
<br />
<br />

- **MMP** user options can be set via the Ctrl-**[\\]** [Config Dialog](ConfigDialog:General) and are recorded in the _MinimalistMediaPlayer.conf_ file
- for user options, any reference to the _MinimalistMediaPlayer.conf_ file in these topics is also an implied reference to the Shift-**[\\]** Config Dialog
- when either Help Panel is open, all **MMP** controls are available to use
- consequently, you can read up on a particular topic while also trying it out
- you can also open the Shift-**[\\]** [Config Dialog](ConfigDialog:General) without closing this Full Help panel first

<br />

- when opened from the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** this panel will be set to "Stay On Top"
- this is an unavoidable consequence of how the **Main Media Window** operates in the background with the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** open
<br />

All of the alphabetical controls (and many of the others, too) were chosen so that there was
  - some direct link to a related word in English starting with that letter, or
  - some relation between the key and the **MMP** control it represents, or
  - some relation to other keys on a typical, full-sized QWERTY keyboard,
  - this was [and is] a concerted effort to make all the controls as straight-forward to remember as possible
  - the ability for users to define custom keyboard overrides is in the development pipeline for **MMP**

- this can be accessed at any time from within **MMP** using Ctrl-**[W]**
