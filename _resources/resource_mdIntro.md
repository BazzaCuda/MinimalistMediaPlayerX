_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close this help panel, either hit **[Escape]** or use Ctrl-Shift-**[H]** again_
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ctrl-**[H]** Quick Help panels (available from the **Main Media Window** and the **Image & Thumbnail Browser**) give a compact summary of all the user-controls available in those windows

_This_ Ctrl-_Shift_-**[H]** Full Help panel, on the other hand, gives a concise but much more detailed explanation for each topic. It and is therefore more suitable for quickly becoming familiar with a particular aspect of **MMP**

- **MMP** user options can be set via the Ctrl-**[\\]** Config Dialog and are recorded in the _MinimalistMediaPlayer.conf_ file
- for user options, any reference to the _MinimalistMediaPlayer.conf_ file in these topics is also an implied reference to the Ctrl-**[\\]** Config Dialog
- when either Help Panel is open, all **MMP** controls are available to use
- consequently, you can read up on a particular topic while also trying it out
- when opened from the **Image & Thumbnail Browser** this panel will be set to "Stay On Top"
- this is an unavoidable consequence of how the **Main Media Window** interacts with the **Image & Thumbnail Browser**
<br />

- the full Wiki for **MMP: Minimalist Media Player** can be read at [MinimalistMediaPlayer.com](https://minimalistmediaplayer.com)<br />
