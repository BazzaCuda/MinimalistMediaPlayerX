Unless you explicitly move the **MMP** window off-center, somehow, it will always be auto-centered to sit in the middle of your desktop

- if you resize the window using **[G]** or Ctrl-**[G]** _(to make the window [G]reater or un[G]reater)_, **MMP** will re-center the window automatically
- if you resize the window by grabbing the bottom edge or corner with your mouse and dragging the window to a greater/smaller size, this will **_cancel_** auto-centering
- if you drag the window around the desktop by holding down the _left mouse button_, this too will **_cancel_** auto-centering
<br />

- when auto-centering has been cancelled, the **MMP** window will remain where it is even if you navigate to a different media file<br />
- the **MMP** window will resize (if necessary) in situ, to accommodate the dimensions of the new media file
- at any time, having moved the **MMP** window off-center, you can re-active _Auto-Center_ using **[H]**
- this is also true with **[M]**, which resizes **MMP** to the [M]aximum allowable for your desktop while also maintaining the media file's aspect ratio
