You can **Fast Forward** or **Fast Rewind** using either **[Tab]** or **[T]**

In **MMP** this is called _tabbing_

- **[Tab]** plays forwards or backwards rapidly by skipping either 1 or 2 seconds
- **[T]** plays forwards or backwards rapidly by skipping a fraction of the total duration
<br />
<br />
- Both keys can be held down for rapid repeat
- the number of seconds skipped is reported in the Notification Area in the bottom right corner
- you can also rapidly "scrub"/"jog" through the audio or video file - see the second table below
<br />

<div align="center">
N.B. tabbing by a 50th/100th/200th of the total duration <br /> rather than by a set number of seconds <br />allows you to tab through all audio and video files at the same rate<br /> relative to their various durations
